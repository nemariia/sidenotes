# Sidenotes Obsidian plugin

A simple plugin to implement sidenotes as we would do by hand

# TODO

- [ ] Add a sidenote
- [ ] Predefined sidenote categories
- [ ] Custom sidenote categories
- [ ] Navigation by sidenotes
- [ ] Customize folder(s) to save sidenotes
- [ ] Different folders for different categories? Or a sidenote folder for each folder/tag/etc.
- [ ] Only a category is visible in the original note, not the full sidenote
- [ ] In the sidenote navigation, you can see categories and axpand to see full sidenotes
